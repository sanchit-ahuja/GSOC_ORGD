# GSOC_ORGS

Implemented my learning of a web scraping library Scrapy to extract orgs who have Python as their tech stack.

### Installation of Scrapy

``` pip install Scrapy```

### Instructions to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. cd into the cloned repository via the terminal.
3. Then run ```scrapy crawl gsoc```

Right now, it just scrapes off the org names in a txt file. I will append the ideas list link along with the org name in a csv file.
