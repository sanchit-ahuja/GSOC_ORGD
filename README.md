# GSOC_ORGS

Implemented my learning of a web scraping library Scrapy to extract orgs who have Python as their tech stack.

### Installation of Scrapy

``` pip install Scrapy```

### Instructions to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. cd into the cloned repository via the terminal.
3. Then run ```scrapy crawl gsoc -a techno="YOUR LANGUAGE>final.csv```

You can now change the language argument to the language of your choice and can get your file in either csv or txt. It will also scrape off the idea list links of every org. :)
